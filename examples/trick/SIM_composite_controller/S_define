     * Generally, you should not require specific devices to drive your

     * Controller and does not care about what physical device(s) ultimately
     * end up servicing that interface. Thus, while the beginner examples
     * declared devices in this section for simplicity, you should usually
     * not do that.

    /**
     * While devices represent physical hardware, a controller represents a
     * virtual interface into a control system. This separation allows
     * control system developers to program against a domain-specific interface
     * independent of any particular device that might service that
     * interface. It further ensures that only devices that have been
     * specifically mapped to the interface may be assigned to service it.
     *
     * CompositeControllers provide further flexibility by not limiting the
     * number of controllers that may be used to service an interface. For
     * instance, a user may have two input devices and wish to use them both as
     * controllers. Or the developer may want to support local devices, remote
     * devices, and the Virtual Hand Controller simultaneously. Each device
     * could be mapped to a SingleController which is then added to a
     * CompositeController. Thus, you should generally prefer declaring
     * instances of CompositeControllers.
